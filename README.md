Face Mask Detection Model
This repository contains a deep learning model designed for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in images or videos. The model is trained using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and leverages a dataset of labeled images with and without face masks to identify the presence of masks in real-time scenarios.

Features
Real-time Face Mask Detection: The model can detect if a person is wearing a face mask or not in images and videos.
CNN-Based Architecture: Utilizes a robust Convolutional Neural Network for image classification.
High Accuracy: The model is trained with a diverse dataset to achieve high performance in various real-world scenarios.
Easy to Use: The project includes a user-friendly script to process images or video feeds.
Pre-trained Model: A pre-trained version of the model is available for quick deployment.
Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/face-mask-detection.git
cd face-mask-detection
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset
The model is trained on a custom dataset that includes images of individuals wearing masks and individuals without masks. The dataset is balanced and diverse, containing images from various angles, lighting conditions, and environments.

Model Architecture
The model uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The output layer classifies the input image into two categories: "Mask" and "No Mask."
